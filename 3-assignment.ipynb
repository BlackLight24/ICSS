It allows you to use logical building blocks for your code, which is especially important for more extensive software projects. You can score up to 3 points in this assignment. Please submit your solutions by sending it to **marc.luettecke@subsequent.ai** or **anna.bahss@uni-konstanz.de** (ideally both). Please include \"**Python Blockkurs 2020 Assignment 3**\" in the subject line of the email. The deadline for submission is on **Thursday, October 29, 09:59**, everything submitted after will automatically receive a grade of 0/3.\n",
